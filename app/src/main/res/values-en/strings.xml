    <string name="pericolo1_desc">Some types of waste are defined as hazardous because of the consequences they may have on human health and the environment surrounding it. /br></string>
    <string name="pericolo5_desc"><br> The cartridges used in laser, inkjet, needle printers and drum units for photocopiers are waste to be collected separately and should not be thrown into the unsorted waste bin.  </br>         <br> Those of domestic origin can be taken free of charge to the Ecological Islands, to the Ecovan + trucks set up for the collection of bulky and dangerous waste and small WEEE.   </br>         <br> Freelancers and companies, as long as they are registered in the National Register of Environmental Managers in category 2 bis, can take their cartridges and toners to the Ecological Islands and Ecovan + trucks without filling in the waste identification and transport form, if you do not exceeds the daily quantity of 30 kg or 30 liters and if no more than 5 contributions are made per calendar year.  </br>         <br> Beyond the fifth contribution in the calendar year, those who need it will have to register with the register (if they have the right) and will have to fill out the form to deliver the waste.   </br>         <br> Alternatively, they can take advantage of a customized collection service for a fee by writing to contacts@amiu.genova.it or by calling 010 80 89 800. In this way the cartridges and toner will be reused thus extending their life cycle. </br></string>
    <string name="pericolo4_desc"><br> Batteries and drugs are hazardous waste that should NOT be thrown into the bin. In fact, they contain pollutants that must not end up in landfills or dispersed in the environment.   </br>         <br> Used batteries of all types (stylus, torch, tablet, etc.) are hazardous waste as they consist of heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, nickel and lead. Thanks to the separate collection, they are treated and disposed of in special plants.  </br>         <br> Find containers for the separate collection of batteries in supermarkets, shops and affiliated resellers (tobacconists, appliance stores, etc.).   </br>         <br> Batteries and drugs can also be brought free of charge to Ecovan + and after specific treatment, they will be disposed of properly, thus avoiding damage to the environment. </br></string>
    <string name="pericolo3_desc"><br> It has been calculated that 160 million kilos of exhausted vegetable oil from households are produced in Italy every year. This is the oil from frying, canned tuna or that contained in the jars of preserves or leftover from the salad.   </br>         <br> Often the oil is not separated correctly, but thrown into the sink, with considerable damage from both an economic and environmental point of view. If introduced into the sewer system, it ends up in the municipal purifier which, to treat a kilo of oil, uses at least 3 kw / h of energy and costs about 50 cents.   </br>         <br> Used oil, if properly sorted, is recyclable and, moreover, it is a precious resource: from a kilo of oil, in fact, it is possible to obtain biofuel with low environmental impact or glycerin for the cosmetic industry. In Genoa this type of oil is collected: in the ecological islands, by the EcoVan + truck (see the appointments).   </br>         <br> Through the Riciclolio project, co-financed by the Life + Community Program, the oil collection system has been expanded through the installation of special containers distributed in schools, neighborhood associations and meeting points.   </br>         <br> Citizens have these points at their disposal to bring used oil which will then be collected and sent for recycling.   </br>         <br> It is important to remember that these containers are used only for the collection of edible oil from home and it is forbidden to insert motor oil (that of the machines and that can be delivered to the ecological islands and on the EcoVan + truck.   </br></string>
    <string name="pericolo2_desc"><br> What are WEEE? Electric and electronic appliances that are powered by electricity, by connecting them to the home socket or with batteries, no longer working that we want to throw away.   </br>         <br> Here is an example of the main WEEE:   </br>         <br> televisions, food processors, toasters, microwave ovens, computers, modems, mobile phones, utensils, toys powered by batteries or batteries or electric wires, clocks, refrigerators, washing machines and other household appliances.   </br>         <br> According to their characteristics, they are divided into 5 categories:   </br>         <br> - R1: Cold and climate (eg refrigerators and air conditioners, air conditioning appliances  </br>         <br> - R2: Large whites (eg washing machines, dishwashers, microwave ovens, range cookers)  </br>         <br> - R3: TVs and monitors (televisions, computer monitors)  </br>         <br> - R4: Information technology, consumer electronics and small household appliances (e.g. vacuum cleaners, sewing machines, irons, fryers, blenders, computers (central unit, mouse, keyboard), printers, fax machines, mobile phones, video recorders, radios, ceiling lights)  </br>         <br> - R5: Light sources (e.g. neon, low consumption lamps - N.B. old incandescent bulbs are not WEEE and must be thrown in unsorted waste)   </br>         <br> Where do I throw the WEEE? For a correct collection of WEEE the first thing to do is to separate the waste. AMIU provides several free services to help you differentiate them, WEEE:   </br>         <br> - They can be taken to ecological islands (all types of WEEE) </br>         <br> - They can be taken to EcoVan (all types of WEEE) / n / n </br>         <br> For large appliances (refrigerators, kitchens, televisions, ...) it is also possible to request the home collection service for a fee. The stores that sell electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) also collaborate in the collection, in different ways: when you buy a new equipment, take the old one to your shopkeeper who can collect it for free. This obligation applies to all businesses that distribute EEE of any kind, even in the case of teleshopping, online sales or home delivery.  </br><br>In addition, the new WEEE legislation has introduced the 1 against 0 obligation for large distributors. Consumers can deliver small WEEE - less than 25 cm - free of charge to large points of sale, with a sales area of ​​electrical and electronic equipment exceeding 400 square meters, without any obligation to purchase. Even small shops can decide to join this initiative on a voluntary basis.   </br>         <br> Why separate WEEE? From a TV you get ferrous metals (48%), plastic (21%), printed circuits (9.8%), glass (8%) and more. From correctly recycled small appliances we can obtain plastic for garden or printed accessories, copper for new taps and silver, palladium, gold and aluminum.   </br>         <br> Collecting and recycling them correctly means:   </br>         <br> - Reduce CO2 emissions: because we reduce greenhouse gases and the substances contained are eliminated safely.  </br>         <br> - Saving energy: because today recycling consumes less energy than what is needed to extract raw materials.  </br>         <br> - Recovering raw materials from waste: because aluminum, glass, copper and plastic can be largely reused.  </br>         <br> - Fighting the illegal trafficking of electronic devices to developing countries: because in the poorest countries they are not recycled properly, polluting and increasing child labor. </br></string>
    <string name="differenziata1_desc"><br> Paper is composed of cellulosic fibers normally present in nature. These, through chemical processes, once dust, dyes and adhesives have been eliminated, can be re-aggregated again and then recycled. Properly recycling paper allows you to recover materials and benefit the environment. \\n\\n </br>         <br> To recycle paper: \\ n \\ n </br>         <br> - Use only the white containers \\ n </br>         <br> - Minimize clutter: folding newspapers, crushing cardboard boxes to reduce their volume and using paper bags \\n </br>         <br> - Do not put the card in plastic bags. This lowers the quality of the collected material and increases the costs of recycling \\n </br>         YOU CAN INTRODUCE IN THE WHITE CONTATINER (ATTENTION: to comply with the regulations the container for paper throughout the city will become BLUE. The containers will be progressively replaced.) \\n\\n         <br> - Paper and cardboard of all sizes \\n </br>         <br> - Non-laminated newspapers, magazines and advertising brochures \\n </br>         <br> - Books and notebooks \\n </br>         <br> - Paper for graphic, drawing and photocopying uses \\n </br>         <br> - Beverage carton (eg Tetra Pak for milk, fruit juices, cream) \\n </br>         <br> - Paper bags \\n </br>         <br> - Boxes and packaging in paper, cardboard, corrugated cardboard and wrapping paper \\n </br>         DO NOT PUT INTO THE WHITE CONTAINER \\n \\n         <br> Dirty paper (eg used napkins and paper plates), greaseproof paper for food, absorbent paper for kitchen and baking paper, plasticized paper, diapers, chemical paper for fax and carbonless, polystyrene and plastic bags. When possible, reduce the volumes. </br></string>

    <string name="differenziata2_desc"><br> Glass is a material obtained by melting a mixture of silica sand, soda (sodium carbonate) and limestone at very high temperatures (about 1,500 degrees). If abandoned in the environment, glass degrades over a very long time, while it can be recycled over and over again. Recycling glass means collecting it separately, crushing it and mixing it with more soda and limestone, melting it at much lower temperatures than those required with virgin material. This allows considerable energy and economic savings on the extraction and melting phases of raw materials. \\n \\n </br>         <br> To recycle glass: \\n \\n </br>         <br> - Use only green containers \\n </br>         <br> - Do not introduce ceramics and porcelain: these materials have a different melting point and can damage large quantities of glass during processing \\n </br>         <br> - Introduce glass free from any foreign material into the bells: caps, labels, lids. They must be recycled individually depending on the material \\n </br>         <br> - Prefer the glass packaging as a returnable empty: it allows a saving of raw materials and energy \\n \\n </br>         YOU CAN PUT into the GREEN container \\n \\n         <br> - Bottles and glasses \\n </br>         <br> - Jars, jars and glass containers of any color, without cap \\n \\n </br>         DO NOT PUT into the GREEN container \\n \\n         <br> Ceramics and porcelain (whole or broken crockery), mirrors, window glass, wired glass, neon bulbs and tubes, TV screens and monitors, jars with remnants of colors or paints, different materials such as crystals \\n \\n </br>         <br> Please note: The packaging must not be washed, to avoid bad smells just rinse it quickly, the labels must not be removed, but the residues must be removed. </br></string>
